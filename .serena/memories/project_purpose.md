# Project Purpose

**Object Proportion Analysis Tool**

This is a React-based web application for analyzing object proportions and positions in images. Key features include:

- **Image Upload & Analysis**: Load images and perform geometric analysis
- **Parent/Child Region Selection**: Define parent regions and child objects within them
- **Grid Overlay System**: 16x16, 32x32, or custom grid overlays for precise positioning
- **Proportion Calculations**: Calculate area ratios, width/height ratios, and aspect ratios
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Convert between pixel coordinates and grid coordinates
- **Data Export**: Export analysis results to JSON and CSV formats
- **Interactive Canvas**: HTML5 Canvas-based interface for region selection and manipulation

The tool is designed for analyzing spatial relationships and proportions of objects within images, useful for design, research, or analytical purposes.
